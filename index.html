                    <p>
                        Many students and employees are upset about how each day the shuttles time differs and is not constant which delays them. Variables that contribute to this problem include the drivers schedule, stopped trains, and conditions on the highways. To help combat this, we plan to create an application that tracks the location of shuttles and time their arrival as accurately as possible so that our users know what time the shuttle is coming and they can use this information to decide if they should choose another source of transportation that day.
